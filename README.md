## 3D-print CAD models to hold many Nordic DK's organized in a setup

The 3D CAD models are done in a tool called "CadQuery" 
CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python library for building parametric 3D CAD models

# Download's 
CadQuery can be downloaded from GIT-hub here: 
	https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery

# Integrating CadQuery into VScode is described here:
	https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roipoussiere.cadquery	

# Documentation/manual of CadQuery here:
	https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

The main intention with these 3D-models is the following:
	* get 3D-printable part's to hold many DK's secure in tight spaces like a RF-chamber
	* secure the coax-test-connector on DK's when a coax cable connection is required 
	* to be able to replace a single DK easy and efficient on a setup with many DK's
	* have stl/step-files available for 3D-printing
	* easy to single step in CadQuery-editor for debugging
	* relativly easy to understand the model's by single stepping through the code.
	* making some models available via Nordic's playground for customers since they have the same needs
